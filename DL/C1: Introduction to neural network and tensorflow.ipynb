    "- A neuron is a mathematical function that takes input, processes them and produces output\n",
    "- It is a computational unit that:\n",
    "    1. Recieves inputs\n",
    "    2. Applies weights to each input\n",
    "    3. Sumbs them up and adds a bias term\n",
    "        - $\\mathrm{z} = \\sum(w_i \\cdot x_i) + b$\n",
    "    4. Passes the result to an activation function to introduce non-linearity\n",
    "        - $\\mathrm{y} = f(z)$\n",
    "- Neurons are also called as unit or nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Neural Network\n",
    "- It is a computational model inspired by how the human brain works\n",
    "- It consists of layers of nodes/neurons connected by weighted links\n",
    "- Layers\n",
    "    - Input Layer $\\to$ takes raw data\n",
    "    - Hidden layers $\\to$ extract feature through transformations\n",
    "    - Ouput layer $\\to$ gives the prediction\n",
    "- During training, it adjusts weights using backpropogation with an optimizer like gradient descent\n"
