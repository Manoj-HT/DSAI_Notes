    "## Smoothing\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition :** It is a technique to remove noise (random fluctauions) from a time series\n",
    "- It helps highlight underlying pattern or trend that is otherwise hidden\n",
    "- We apply mathematical methods to smooth out sharp ups and downs\n",
    "- Instead of reacting to every spike/ dip, smoothing creates a gentler curve of the data\n",
    "- **Goal :** \n",
    "    - Reduce short term irregular variations so we can clearly see trend, seasonality or cycles\n",
    "    - Provide baseline forecasting method\n",
    "    - compare more advanced models against these\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building a model\n",
    "\n",
    "To build a forecasting model we follow the following steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Problem & data understanding\n",
    "    - Define what to forecast\n",
    "    - Collect historical time series data with consistent intervals\n",
    "2. Data Preprocessing\n",
    "    - Handle missing values: impute or interpolate\n",
    "    - Remove or adjust outliers, if they are not meaningful\n",
    "    - Convert data into stationary series if required\n",
    "3. Exploratory analysis\n",
    "    - Plot the series, identify the trend, seasonality, cycles or noise\n",
    "    - Use Autocorrelation and PACF plots to understand lags\n",
    "    - perform tests like ADF tests for stationarity\n",
    "4. Choose forecasting Approach\n",
    "    - There are two major approaches\n",
    "        1. Statistical models\n",
    "            - ARIMA/SARIMA\n",
    "            - Exponential smoothing\n",
    "        2. Machine learning / Deep learning models\n",
    "            - Regression with lag features\n",
    "            - RandomForest / XGBoost\n",
    "            - RNN / LSTM / Transformer models\n",
    "5. Model training\n",
    "    - Split data inti train and test sets\n",
    "    - Fit the chose model on training data\n",
    "    - Tune hyper parameters\n",
    "6. Model evaluation\n",
    "    - Compare forecast accuracy using metrics like MAE, RMSE,MAPE\n",
    "    - Check if residuals look like random noise\n",
    "7. Forecasting Deployment\n",
    "    - Generate future predictions\n",
    "    - Update the model regulary as new data arrives\n",
    "    - deploy into production\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of forecasting models\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Simple average forecast**\n",
    "- We forecast by taking the mean of all past observations\n",
    "- Naive but provides a baseline forecast\n",
    "- $\\mathrm{\\hat{y}_{t+1}} = \\frac{y_1 + y_2 + ... + y_{t+1}}{t}$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Moving average forecast**\n",
    "- We forecast by taking the mean of last 'k' values\n",
    "- Handles short term fluctuations better\n",
    "- Con: lags the series\n",
    "- $\\mathrm{\\hat{y}_{t+1}} = \\frac{y_{t} + y_{t-1} + ... + y_{t-k+1}}{t}$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Exponential smoothing technique**\n",
    "- We forecast by giving more weight to recent observations\n",
    "- $\\hat{y}_{t+1} = \\alpha y_t + (1-\\alpha)\\hat{y}_t$\n",
    "- where $0 < \\alpha < 1$ (smoothing factoe)\n",
    "- If $\\alpha$ is high this means that recent data is more important\n",
    "- If $\\alpha$ is low this means that older data still\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Double exponential smoothing**\n",
    "- Handles trend in the data\n",
    "- Uses two equations:\n",
    "    - Level : current estimate of series\n",
    "    - Trend : growth rate\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Holt winters method**\n",
    "- This model handles trend as well as seasonality.\n",
    "- Variants: \n",
    "    - Additive: constant seasonality\n",
    "    - Multiplicative: seasonality grows with trend\n",
    "- This has been used widely in practice\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model validation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Need of validation\n",
    "- To check if model genralizes to unseen future data\n",
    "- Doing a random train/test split would break time order\n",
