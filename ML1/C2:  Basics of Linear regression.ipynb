    "# C2: BASICS OF LINEAR REGRESSION\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Linear Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition:** A supervised learning algorithm used to predict a continuous value by finding the best-fitting straight line through the data.  \n",
    "- **Equation:**  \n",
    "  **Simple Linear Regression:**  \n",
    "  $y = b_0 + b_1x$  \n",
    "  - $y$ = Predicted value  \n",
    "  - $x$ = Input feature  \n",
    "  - $b_0$ = Intercept  \n",
    "  - $b_1$ = Slope (Change in $y$ when $x$ increases by 1)  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Simple Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uses one input feature.  \n",
    "- Example: Predicting house price based only on house size.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Multiple Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uses more than one input feature.  \n",
    "- Equation:  \n",
    "  $y = b_0 + b_1x_1 + b_2x_2 + \\dots + b_nx_n$  \n",
    "- Example: Predicting house price based on number of bedrooms, house size, location score, etc.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Covariance and Correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Covariance:** Shows the direction of the relationship (positive/negative) between two variables.  \n",
    "  - Formula:  \n",
    "    $\\mathrm{Cov}(X,Y) = \\dfrac{\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})}{n-1}$  \n",
    "  - Positive: Both increase together.  \n",
    "  - Negative: One increases while the other decreases.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Correlation:** Standardized form of covariance, ranges from -1 to +1.  \n",
    "  - Formula:  \n",
    "    $r = \\dfrac{\\mathrm{Cov}(X,Y)}{\\sigma_x \\sigma_y}$  \n",
    "  - $r = 1$ → Perfect positive correlation.  \n",
    "  - $r = -1$ → Perfect negative correlation.  \n",
    "  - $r = 0$ → No linear relationship.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Regression Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Goal:** Find coefficients $b_0, b_1, \\dots, b_n$ that minimize the prediction error.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Method to find the best-fitting line by minimizing the **Sum of Squared Errors (SSE):**  \n",
    "  $\\mathrm{SSE} = \\sum (y_i - \\hat{y_i})^2$  \n",
    "- The line with the minimum SSE is chosen.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## $R^2$ and Adjusted $R^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **$R^2$ (Coefficient of Determination):**  \n",
    "  - Measures how much variance in $y$ is explained by the model.  \n",
    "  - Range: 0 to 1 (higher is better).  \n",
    "  - Formula:  \n",
    "    $R^2 = 1 - \\dfrac{SSE}{SST}$  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Adjusted $R^2$:** Corrects $R^2$ for multiple predictors.  \n",
    "  - Prevents artificial inflation when adding irrelevant variables.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Inferences and Slope\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hypothesis testing for slope:  \n",
    "  - $H_0: b_1 = 0$ → No relationship between $x$ and $y$.  \n",
    "  - $H_a: b_1 \\neq 0$ → Relationship exists.  \n",
    "- If **p-value < significance level** (e.g., 0.05), reject $H_0$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Linear Regression with Time Series (Autoregression)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Predicts a variable using its past values.  \n",
    "- Example: Predict today’s stock price based on the last 5 days.  \n"
