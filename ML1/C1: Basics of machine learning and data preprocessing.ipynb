    "# C1: BASICS OF MACHINE LEARNING & DATA PREPROCESSING\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Machine Learning**: Machine Learning (ML) is a field of AI where computers learn patterns from data and make predictions/decisions without being explicitly programmed.  \n",
    "- **Goal**: Create models that improve automatically as they receive more data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Traditional Programming vs Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "| **Traditional Programming**           | **Machine Learning**                       |\n",
    "| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |\n",
    "| Rules are explicitly coded by humans. | Model learns rules from data.              |\n",
    "| Input + Rules → Output                | Input + Output → Model (rules)             |\n",
    "| Used when logic is well-known.        | Used when logic is complex or unknown.     |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:  \n",
    "- Traditional: Writing rules to detect spam emails manually.  \n",
    "- ML: Feed thousands of labeled emails → model learns spam patterns automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding an ML Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting any ML project:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define the Problem – What do we want to predict?  \n",
    "2. Understand Data – What features are available? What’s the target variable?  \n",
    "3. Identify ML Type – Regression, Classification, Clustering, etc.  \n",
    "4. Decide Success Metric – Accuracy, RMSE, etc.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps in an ML Project\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Collection  \n",
    "2. Data Preprocessing (cleaning, encoding, scaling, etc.)  \n",
    "3. Splitting into Train & Test sets  \n",
    "4. Choosing a Model (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, etc.)  \n",
    "5. Training the Model  \n",
    "6. Evaluating Performance  \n",
    "7. Hyperparameter Tuning  \n",
    "8. Deploying the Model  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Terms in ML\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feature / Variable / Input (X)** – Information used for prediction.  \n",
    "- **Target / Label / Output (y)** – What we want to predict.  \n",
    "- **Model** – Mathematical function that maps input → output.  \n",
    "- **Training** – Model learns from data.  \n",
    "- **Testing** – Evaluating the model on unseen data.  \n",
    "- **Overfitting** – Model memorizes training data but fails on new data.  \n",
    "- **Underfitting** – Model is too simple; performs poorly on both train & test.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Supervised Learning** – Model learns with labeled data (X → y).  \n",
    "   - **Regression**: Predict continuous values (e.g., house price).  \n",
    "   - **Classification**: Predict categories (e.g., spam/ham).  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Unsupervised Learning** – No labels, model finds patterns.  \n",
    "   - **Clustering**: Group similar items (e.g., customer segmentation).  \n",
    "   - **Dimensionality Reduction**: Compress data (e.g., PCA).  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reinforcement Learning** – Model learns by interacting with the environment (e.g., a game agent learning by trial & error).  \n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Data Preprocessing?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Raw data is often incomplete, noisy, or inconsistent.  \n",
    "- Preprocessing cleans and transforms data so ML models can learn effectively.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## General Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Handling Missing Values**  \n",
    "   - Types of Missing Data:  \n",
    "     1. **Standard missing values**: Represented as `NaN`, `Null`, empty space.  \n",
    "     2. **Non-standard missing values**: Represented as `?`, `-`, `Not available`.  \n",
    "   - Methods to handle missing values:  \n",
    "     1. Remove rows/columns.  \n",
    "     2. Impute values:  \n",
    "        - Mean/median (for numeric).  \n",
    "        - Mode (for categorical).  \n",
    "        - Predict missing value using another model (advanced).  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Handling Non-Numeric Data**  \n",
    "   - ML models cannot handle text directly, so convert to numbers.  \n",
    "     - **One-Hot Encoding**: Creates new columns (0/1) for each category.  \n",
    "     - **Label Encoding**: Assigns integer codes (0,1,2...) to categories.  \n",
    "     - **Ordinal Encoding**: Similar to label encoding but preserves order (e.g., low < medium < high).  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Normalization & Transformation**  \n",
    "   - **Normalization**: Scale values between 0 and 1 → `x' = (x - min)/(max - min)`.  \n",
    "   - **Standardization**: Transform to mean = 0, std = 1 → `z = (x - mean)/std`.  \n",
    "   - **Why?** Models like regression and SVM are sensitive to scale.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Outlier Detection & Removal**  \n",
    "   - Outliers can negatively affect models (especially linear regression).  \n",
    "     - **Boxplot Method**: Values beyond whiskers.  \n",
    "     - **IQR Method**:  \n",
    "       - IQR = Q3 - Q1.  \n",
    "       - Outliers: < Q1 - 1.5×IQR or > Q3 + 1.5×IQR.  \n",
    "     - **Z-Score Method**: |z| > 3.  \n",
    "     - **Scatterplot**: Visual inspection.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Feature Engineering (Intro)**  \n",
    "   - Creating new features from existing ones. Example: BMI = weight / height².  \n",
    "   - Includes:  \n",
    "     - Feature extraction (PCA, text embeddings).  \n",
    "     - Feature transformation (log, square root).  \n",
    "     - Combining features (ratios, interactions).  \n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Train-Test Split**  \n",
    "   - **Purpose**: To evaluate the model on unseen data.  \n",
    "   - Common split: 70% Train / 30% Test or 80/20.  \n",
    "   - Use `train_test_split()` in scikit-learn.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Applications of ML\n",
    "\n",
    "ML is used in many domains, for example:  \n",
    "- **Healthcare**: Disease prediction, image analysis.  \n",
    "- **Finance**: Credit scoring, fraud detection.  \n",
    "- **Retail**: Recommendation systems, inventory forecasting.  \n",
    "- **Transportation**: Route optimization, self-driving cars.  \n",
    "- **Manufacturing**: Predictive maintenance, defect detection.  \n"
