    "A technique used to find relationships between items frequently bought together.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition:** An unsupervised learning method that identifies associations or co-occurrences among items in transactional data\n",
    "- **Goal:** Discover patterns such as \"If a customer buys X, they are likely to buy Y\"\n",
    "- **Algorithms:** Commonly used association rule learning algorithms like\n",
    "  - Apriori\n",
    "  - FP-Growth\n",
    "  - Eclat\n",
    "- **Applications:**\n",
    "  - Product recommendation\n",
    "  - Cross-selling strategies\n",
    "  - Store layout optimization\n",
    "  - Fraud detection\n",
    "\n",
    "## Association Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Support:** How often items appear together  \n",
    "  - $\\mathrm{Support(X \\Rightarrow Y)} = \\frac{\\text{Transactions with X and Y}}{\\text{Total transactions}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Confidence:** Likelihood of buying Y when X is bought  \n",
    "  - $\\mathrm{Confidence(X \\Rightarrow Y)} = \\frac{\\text{Transactions with X and Y}}{\\text{Transactions with X}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lift:** Strength of association compared to random chance  \n",
    "  - $\\mathrm{Lift(X \\Rightarrow Y)} = \\frac{Confidence(X \\Rightarrow Y)}{Support(Y)}$\n",
    "  - Lift > 1: strong association  \n",
    "  - Lift = 1: independent  \n",
    "  - Lift < 1: negative association  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Apriori Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Find frequent itemsets and generate association rules\n",
    "- **Steps:**\n",
    "  1. Set a minimum support and confidence threshold\n",
    "  2. Generate candidate itemsets of length 1\n",
    "  3. Filter itemsets that meet minimum support\n",
    "  4. Generate larger itemsets\n",
    "  5. Repeat until no more frequent itemsets can be generated\n",
    "  6. Generate association rules\n",
    "- **Advantages:**\n",
    "  - Simple and easy to implement\n",
    "  - Works well for small to medium datasets\n",
    "- **Disadvantages:**\n",
    "  - Can be slow on large datasets\n",
    "  - Requires multiple scans of the database"
